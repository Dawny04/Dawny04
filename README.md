Hi!!! I'm @Dawny04 (❁´◡`❁)

I'm a student of biology and i'm interested in R to work in the science field, so i'm here just to learn.
I'm curious about everything because i don't know really how to work with R by myself, so sorry in advance if i ask to many questions (っ °Д °;)っ

Thank you all for having me 💛💛💛💛
